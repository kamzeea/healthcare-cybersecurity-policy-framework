# Healthcare Cybersecurity Policy Framework

**Overview**

This project consists of the development of **enterprise-level cybersecurity governance policies** for a simulated healthcare organization, **Kamita HealthCare**, designed to protect sensitive systems and electronic Protected Health Information (**e-PHI**).  
The policies establish structured controls for **access management** and **email security**, aligning organizational practices with industry cybersecurity frameworks and healthcare compliance requirements.  
The project demonstrates applied knowledge of **information security governance**, **risk management**, and **regulatory compliance** within a healthcare IT environment.

---

**Project Objective**

The goal of this project was to design formal cybersecurity policies that:

- Protect sensitive healthcare data (**PHI**)  
- Reduce insider and external security risks  
- Enforce **least-privilege access** principles  
- Prevent phishing and email-borne attacks  
- Support **HIPAA** regulatory compliance  
- Strengthen overall organizational security posture  

---

**Organizational Context**

- **Organization:** Kamita HealthCare  
- **Scale:**  
  - 50,000+ patients  
  - 650 staff members  

**Core Systems:**

- Electronic Health Records (**EHR**)  
- **PACS** medical imaging systems  
- Financial systems  
- Internal IT infrastructure  

Policies were designed to operate within a **real-world healthcare security environment**.

**Policies Developed**

1. **Access Management Policy**  

   This policy establishes governance for controlling **user access** to healthcare systems and data resources.

   - **Key Security Controls**
     - Role-Based Access Control (**RBAC**)  
     - Principle of **Least Privilege** enforcement  
     - Access Control Lists (**ACLs**)  
     - **Quarterly access reviews**  
     - **Segregation of duties**  
     - Multi-Factor Authentication (**MFA**)  
     - Encryption requirements:  
       - **AES-256** (data at rest)  
       - **TLS 1.3** (data in transit)  

   - **Risk Mitigation Focus**
     - Unauthorized system access  
     - Insider threats  
     - Privilege escalation  
     - PHI exposure risks  

2. **Email Security Management Policy**  

   This policy defines controls for securing organizational **email communication** against cyber threats.

   - **Key Security Controls**
     - **SPF, DKIM, and DMARC** authentication enforcement  
     - **TLS-encrypted** email transmission  
     - Anti-phishing filtering  
     - Malware scanning and **sandboxed attachments**  
     - **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** filtering  
     - Domain monitoring and validation  
     - Secure file transfer alternatives  

   - **Risk Mitigation Focus**
     - Phishing attacks  
     - Malware delivery  
     - Social engineering threats  
     - Data exfiltration via email  

---

**Security Framework Alignment**

Policies were developed using industry standards and guidance, including:

- **HIPAA Security Rule**  
- **NIST SP 800-53**  
- **NIST SP 800-45**  
- Healthcare cybersecurity best practices  

---

**Skills Demonstrated**

- **Cybersecurity Governance**
  - Policy development lifecycle  
  - Security control definition  
  - Risk assessment thinking  
  - Compliance alignment  

- **Technical Security Concepts**
  - Identity & Access Management (**IAM**)  
  - **RBAC** architecture  
  - Encryption standards (AES, TLS)  
  - Email authentication protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)  
  - Security monitoring and logging considerations  

- **Documentation & Communication**
  - Enterprise policy writing  
  - Technical-to-business translation  
  - Structured governance documentation  

---

**Real-World Impact**

These policies simulate controls that help organizations:

- Prevent unauthorized access to critical medical systems  
- Reduce phishing attack success rates  
- Protect patient confidentiality and integrity of PHI  
- Maintain **regulatory compliance** in healthcare environments  
- Improve incident response readiness and accountability
